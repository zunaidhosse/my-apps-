# Payment Tracker PWA

This is a Progressive Web App for tracking payments, built with React.

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

Follow these steps to upload the project to GitHub and deploy it as a live website using GitHub Pages.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1.  Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in.
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3.  Give your repository a name (e.g., `payment-tracker-app`).
4.  Choose "Public" for visibility.
5.  Click **"Create repository"**.

### Step 2: Upload Your Project Files

1.  On your new repository's page, click the **"Add file"** button and select **"Upload files"**.
2.  Drag and drop all your project files into the upload area:
    *   `index.html`
    *   `style.css`
    *   `script.js`
    *   `pwa-installer.js`
    *   `service-worker.js`
    *   `manifest.json`
    *   `icon-192.png`
    *   `icon-512.png`
    *   `README.md` (this file)
3.  Once the files are uploaded, add a commit message (e.g., "Initial commit") and click **"Commit changes"**.

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1.  In your repository, click on the **"Settings"** tab.
2.  In the left sidebar, click on **"Pages"**.
3.  Under the "Build and deployment" section, for the **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**.
4.  Under the "Branch" section, select the `main` branch (or `master`) and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.
5.  Click **"Save"**.

### Step 4: Access Your Live App

1.  GitHub will start deploying your site. This might take a minute or two.
2.  Once it's ready, a green bar will appear at the top of the Pages settings with a link to your live site. It will look something like `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.
3.  Click the link to visit your live PWA!

Now your app is live. When you visit the URL on a supported device (like Chrome on Android or Safari on iOS), you should see the "Add to Home Screen" button, allowing you to install it. After installation, the app will be accessible from your home screen and will work offline."# my-apps"
